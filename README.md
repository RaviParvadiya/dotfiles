# exploiter’s Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files for Linux, including:

- **Zsh** (with plugins, completions, aliases, and Starship prompt)
- **Neovim** (Lua-based, with LSP, formatting, and plugin management)
- **tmux** (custom keybindings, theme, and plugin manager)
- **Hyprland** (Wayland compositor, keybinds, and autostart apps)
- **Other tools** (fzf, zoxide, etc.)

## Features

- Modern, modular Neovim setup with LSP, DAP, formatters, and linters
- Productive Zsh shell with autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, and fuzzy completion
